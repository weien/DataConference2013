=================NEED=================
clean up twitter widget (V's recommendations?)
syncing (add method/class)

give WebViewController a better name?
improve load of Tweets tab? so it doesn't display "Tweets about #opendata" link first?

get Apple Dev account so can set up/manage testflights properly

minor bug: weird autorotation issue if switching tabs while in landscape (allowed in WebViewCntrler) -- no easy fix, maybe don't allow rotation at all

=================NICE=================
Tweeting capabilities
Tweet: Prefill with current session
Attendee networking

=================DONE=================
add sync bar
twitter: get from twitter dev site, the actual iframe or whatever (eventually right into Jekyll folder)
crashlytics, then testflight //installed, shared with V/Wolf
add crasher //used crashlytics recommendations for simulating crashes. perfect.
handle URLs out to safari (e.g. bill franks URL) //got simple version, can still improve by opening in webview
just opening http/https differently is tricky due to twitter -- could hack it (twitter widget does troublesome redirects)
sizing for twitter widget. can do conditionally?
fix autorotation (see code for WebViewController) -- allow horizontal only for WebViewController
add forward/backward buttons on WebViewController?
