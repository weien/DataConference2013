=================R1 NEED=================
add currentVersion to NSUserDefaults //better yet, implement jwr's recommendations
make sure we don't try to grab from a location while it's still downloading
add UINetworkActivityIndicator?

get Apple Dev account so can set up/manage testflights properly
minor bug: weird autorotation issue if switching tabs while in landscape (allowed in WebViewCntrler) -- no easy fix, maybe don't allow rotation at all

    
=================R2 NEED=================
asynchronous syncing (add method/class)
header/detail relationships for speakers, sessions, etc.
possibly make storyboard more efficient, without messing up nav bar titles (only after we have more file:// URLs)
=================NICE================
Tweet: Prefill with current session
Attendee networking (attendee list, detail, add to contacts, mail)
Add more information for user if uiwebview fails 
=================DONE=================
add sync bar
twitter: get from twitter dev site, the actual iframe or whatever (eventually right into Jekyll folder)
crashlytics, then testflight //installed, shared with V/Wolf
add crasher //used crashlytics recommendations for simulating crashes. perfect.
handle URLs out to safari (e.g. bill franks URL) //got simple version, can still improve by opening in webview
just opening http/https differently is tricky due to twitter -- could hack it (twitter widget does troublesome redirects)
sizing for twitter widget. can do conditionally?
fix autorotation (see code for WebViewController) -- allow horizontal only for WebViewController
add forward/backward buttons on WebViewController?
clean up twitter widget (V's recommendations?) https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines#customization //done by V
give WebViewController a better name?
tab bar titles
basic app icon
fix white flash (uiwebviews)
final tab bar icons
color behind UIViews (currently black)? (ask V)
add tweeting / iOS 6 / Tweeting capabilities //kind of included with widget
add outlets=nil to viewdidunload?
improve load of Tweets tab? so it doesn't display "Tweets about #opendata" link first? //doesn't seem to be displaying anymore //fixed along with V's aesthetic update and whiteflash fix
=================WATCH=================
stupid crash bug (when clicking on links in uiwebview that is displaying a pdf, as on our news page):  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16080374/uiwebview-pdf-hyperlinks-crash
    update: supposedly will be fixed soon (radar filed) https://twitter.com/aSx_edoc/status/362940341965426689
    lame solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2808267/uiwebview-how-to-disable-action-sheets-uiactionsheet
    or: http://sugartin.info/2012/10/25/avoiddisable-default-actionsheet-for-opencopy-from-a-uiwebview/

twitter view's fit (see tweet box and title in one view) //setting "nofooter" will do for now
